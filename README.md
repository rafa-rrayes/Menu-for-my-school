Hello, i am trying to help my school making a menu for them. this is the operators view. This is my first time with tkinter so, sorry if it is slopy.
All thats missing is to add a sales history in the right screen, the sales should appear there when I click finalizae, the information in it should be: Name, Candy and Price
