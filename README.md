Hello, i am trying to help my school making a menu for them. this is the operators view. This is my first time with tkinter so, sorry if it is sloppy.


This should work like this:
I add a new candy with the button, it apears on the left screen.
If I click it it appears on the botton midle screen, if I select it there, it is removed.
Thats all for now, I want to learn so I wouldn't like people changing everything and finishing in one day. So thats all for now
If you would like to help me I accept.

known issues:
-when added a new candy, it automaticaly goes to the 'Pedidos' tab(midle bottom)
-Error when try to delete order on 'pedidos'
